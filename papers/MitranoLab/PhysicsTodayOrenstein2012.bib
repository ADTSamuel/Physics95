abstract = {Orenstein describes ultrafast spectroscopy of quantum materials. For decades, chemists and biologists have used light pulses with femtosecond durations to witness phenomena ranging from photodissociation to complex pathways in photosynthesis. Lately, an increasing number of researchers are directing ultrashort laser pulses at quantum materials--systems in which strong electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions lead to a multiplicity of competing phases, such as anti-ferromagnetism and superconductivity. Many physicists believe that ultra fast spectroscopic techniques will provide new insights into quantum materials by selectively exciting collective and single-particle modes of such phases and tracking in real time their subsequent decay pathways back to the ground state.},
